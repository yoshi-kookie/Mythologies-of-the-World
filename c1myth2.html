       <h2>Midas Touch</h2>
       <p>Midas was a really arrogant king who loved gold. Stuff happens and he gets granted a wish by the gods. Everything he touches turns into gold. Pretty soon after that, everything in his palace was gold, from the cutlery to the walls. Unfortunately, he got consumed by his ego which made everyone in his land hate him even more. One unfortunate day, he hugged his daughter, forgetting about what his touch does. Predictably his daughter turns into a gold statue, and King Midas feels devastated.</p>
