    <p>Myths are stories that people told to explain things in the world they could not before. There are many myths that are known to almost everyone in this world, such as the stories about greek gods. Myths can originate from any country, and while the most well known are the Greek; Roman; and even Egyptian myths, each country has their own weird and interesting myths.</p>
